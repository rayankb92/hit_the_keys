"the mother gave her baby a red apple. The baby tried to eat the apple \
His mouth was too small. And he didn't have any teeth. His brother took the apple\
. His brother ate the apple. The baby cried. His brother gave the baby a blue ball\
to play with.", 
"My family is a rather small one, with only three people, my father, my mother and \
me. My father is a doctor. My mother is a middle-school teacher. I am still a student\
. My mother is very gentle and soft while my father is a little bit hot-tempered. We \
love each other very much. Although sometimes we might become angry at one another, \
very soon we will forget the unpleasant things. We're a happy family, how about you?",

"It's a windy day. The wind is blowing hard. Paper is blowing everywhere. The wind \
blew the man's hat off. It blew the woman's hat off. It blew a bird off the telephone\
 wire. The other birds laughed. The wind keeps blowing. The trees are bending over. The\
people outside are bending over. The wind makes it hard to walk. The wind makes it hard \
to drive. The big trucks have to pull over."
